### Bioinformatics Workshop #2: Preprocessing and mapping reads to a reference genome for RNAseq and SNP analyses.

#### Workshop goal:


1. To learn about popular file formats (fastq, sam/bam/, gff/gtf/, VCF).
2. To learn how to generate and interpret QC data from sequencing reads.
3. To learn how to trim reads.
4. Try different read mappers (STAR, BWA) with RNAseq and WGS sequencing datasets.
5. Remove/flag duplicated reads.
6. Quantification of reads per gene.
8. SNP/INDEL calls.
9. To learn how to generate wig, bigwig, tdf and bed files from bam files for visualization in IGV.
